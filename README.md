# Retroboy-Advance


| |
|---|
| *Retroboy* was build by [mikljohansson](https://github.com/mikljohansson). |
It's a camera-app for android that implements various filters that mimics
different   old-school devices. I'm not sure yet what I'm gonna do with it,  
mainly because I'm not sure what I'm gonna be able to do. Some UI elements  
don't seem to be working right on my phone. I can't adjust the exposure value  
correctly. Whenever I touch it, it jumps to "2" and I#m seldomly able to change   
it afterwards. I thought I found a hidden setting, "focus marker", but now I realised  
that you can scroll the settings menu. It's just not communicated. I'm gonna try to  
change this. Some settings I don't really understand or don't notice much of a change  
when adjusting them. If I don't understand, what they do afer reading the code or just   
don't think they are that useful, I'm either gonna change them to have mmore of an effect  
on the picture or just tidy up the menus. I'd also like to add some filters, I'm missing.  
I thought I'd be done after an hour or two, but everything is much more complicated than    
I expected.  I'm still busy figuring out how everything works.
